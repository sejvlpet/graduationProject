# Graduation project
This project deals with algorithmic solving of a task from the game theory with a finite count of solutions. The thesis proposes these algorithms, proves their correctness, analyzes their asymptotic complexity and tests the results. The primary goal is to create at least two such algorithms solving the given problem in polynomial time.
